Born and raised in Guadalajara, Mexico, I emigrated to Germany at 18 to pursue higher education in physics. After completing the *Ausländerstudienkolleg* at the HTWG in Konstanz, I was awarded a BSc and MSc by the University of Tübingen, where I am currently a PhD candidate working on particle physics phenomenology in the [group of Prof. B. Jäger](https://uni-tuebingen.de/fakultaeten/mathematisch-naturwissenschaftliche-fakultaet/fachbereiche/physik/institute/institut-fuer-theoretische-physik/arbeitsgruppen/ag-jaeger/). Specifically, I develop Monte Carlo programs to simulate high-energy processes at next-to-leading order.
