Born and raised in Guadalajara, Mexico, I emigrated to Germany at 18 to pursue higher education in physics. After completing the *Ausländerstudienkolleg* at the HTWG in Konstanz, I was awarded a BSc and MSc by the University of Tübingen, where I am currently a PhD candidate working on particle physics phenomenology in the [group of Prof. B. Jäger](https://uni-tuebingen.de/fakultaeten/mathematisch-naturwissenschaftliche-fakultaet/fachbereiche/physik/institute/institut-fuer-theoretische-physik/arbeitsgruppen/ag-jaeger/). Specifically, I develop Monte Carlo programs to simulate high-energy processes at next-to-leading order.

Write your biography here. Tell the world about yourself. Link to your favorite [subreddit](http://reddit.com). You can put a picture in, too. The code is already in, just name your picture `prof_pic.jpg` and put it in the `img/` folder.

Put your address / P.O. box / other info right below your picture. You can also disable any these elements by editing `profile` property of the YAML header of your `_pages/about.md`. Edit `_bibliography/papers.bib` and Jekyll will render your [publications page](/al-folio/publications/) automatically.

Link to your social media connections, too. This theme is set up to use [Font Awesome icons](http://fortawesome.github.io/Font-Awesome/) and [Academicons](https://jpswalsh.github.io/academicons/), like the ones below. Add your Facebook, Twitter, LinkedIn, Google Scholar, or just disable all of them.
