Born and raised in Guadalajara, Mexico, I emigrated to Germany at 18 to pursue a higher education in physics. After completing the *Ausländerstudienkolleg* at the HTWG in Konstanz, I was awarded a BSc and MSc by the University of Tübingen, where I am currently a PhD candidate working in particle physics phenomenology in the [group](https://uni-tuebingen.de/fakultaeten/mathematisch-naturwissenschaftliche-fakultaet/fachbereiche/physik/institute/institut-fuer-theoretische-physik/arbeitsgruppen/ag-jaeger/) of Prof. Jäger.

Put your address / P.O. box / other info right below your picture. You can also disable any these elements by editing `profile` property of the YAML header of your `_pages/about.md`. Edit `_bibliography/papers.bib` and Jekyll will render your [publications page](/santiago-lpch/publications/) automatically.

Link to your social media connections, too. This theme is set up to use [Font Awesome icons](http://fortawesome.github.io/Font-Awesome/) and [Academicons](https://jpswalsh.github.io/academicons/), like the ones below. Add your Facebook, Twitter, LinkedIn, Google Scholar, or just disable all of them.
